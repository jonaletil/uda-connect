Architecture decisions:

In order to refactor the monolith application to microservice architecture, I created three new separate microservices:

1. Person Microservice (REST API message passing)
2. Connection Microservice (REST API message passing)
3. Location Microservice (gRPC and Kafka message passing)

- REST API
Both Person and Connection microservices use REST API message passing technique.
These services do not have special requirements, so using REST API is the best and most reliable solution with less complexity.

-gRPC and Kafka
Because we will be expecting a lot of data coming simultaneously (data streaming) from mobile devices in Location microservice, gRPC and Kafka message passing techniques are the best solution.
gRPC enforces high performance and can run in any environment.
Kafka is perfect for handling massive amount of data, and it is highly scalable and durable.
